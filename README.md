This project is an attempt to raise awareness about the semicolon tattoo which is associated with mental health. It is also born out of a frustration of people using the amazing web3 technology very superficially, such as NFT flipping. Semicolon fingers provides a platform to mint colourful semicolon tattoo NFTs along with a story. Users decide on their mood by selecting a hue and how much they are feeling that hue by selecting saturation. They then write out their story and mint it as an NFT with a semicolon tattoo. Other users may read stories filtered by hues or directly by a token [read: story] ID. If the story they be reading touches their heart, they may choose to mint that story and hodl it in their wallet as a token of support. A more complete version of the dApp will also include Superfluid money streaming so people may potentially earn money for simply speaking their hearts out.
